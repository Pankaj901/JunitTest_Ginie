### ğŸ“‚ Installation
    # Step 1: Clone this repository
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/JunitTest_Ginie.git
    cd JunitTest_Ginie


    # Step 2: Install prerequisites
    # (Java, Maven, Git, Python, Diffblue CLI must be installed manually)

    # Step 3: Configure auto_test_pr_diffblue_windows.py
    GITHUB_TOKEN = "your_personal_github_token"
    REPO_URL = "https://github.com/your-username/your-java-repo.git"
    BRANCH_NAME = "feature/auto-generated-tests"
    COVERAGE_THRESHOLD = 95
    MAX_RETRIES = 3
    DIFFBLUE_CLI_PATH = r"C:\path\to\diffblue.exe"


    # Step 4: Ensure required tools are in PATH
    # java, mvn, git, diffblue.exe


## â–¶ Usage
    # Run the script from PowerShell or Command Prompt
    python auto_test_pr_diffblue_windows.py

The script will:
1. Clone the target GitHub repository
2. Generate JUnit tests in src/test/java using Diffblue
3. Build & run tests with Maven
4. Measure coverage with JaCoCo
5. Retry if coverage is below target (MAX_RETRIES)
6. Commit & push to a new branch
7. Create a Pull Request on GitHub automatically

## ğŸ“„ Example Output
    [RUN] git clone "https://github.com/example/project.git" "C:\Temp\repo"
    [RUN] "C:\Tools\diffblue.exe" cover create --src "src\main\java" --test "src\test\java" --overwrite
    [RUN] mvn clean test
    Coverage: 96.23%
    âœ… Coverage threshold met: 96.23%
    [RUN] git checkout -b feature/auto-generated-tests
    [RUN] git add src/test/java
    [RUN] git commit -m "Automated JUnit test generation with Diffblue"
    [RUN] git push --set-upstream origin feature/auto-generated-tests
